CocoaPods Library
================


## Test Case
We are currently working on a research project to improve the security of mobile apps.
The published libraries only cover apps that gave their permission to test through their responsible disclosure program. 
Further, we remove the pod at the latest two weeks after publishing.



## Data Collection
We collect the hostname, IP address, and installation directory to be able to report detected issues.
We delete any data at the latest after 31 days or after the issue has been resolved. 


## Contact
For more information, mitigation, to take down or transfer the pod, please contact d.schmidt@univie.ac.at or sebastian.schrittwieser@univie.ac.at.
